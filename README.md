This is my first attempt at writing an operating system from scratch. 

Current Features:
- Partial Ext2 File system implementation
- Working ELF file loader
- System calls
- Keyboard and terminal drivers
- SMP and multitasking


Planned Features:
- TCP/IP stack
- Full user mode shell
- Finish Ext2 implementation
- a GUI
- toy compiler/interpreter for custom scripting language


At some point I will rewrite this in C++
