This is my first attempt at writing an operating system from scratch. 

Current Features:
- Ext2 File System(reads only)
- SMP multitasking
- User mode shell
- Some basic user mode utilities(ls, cat, clear, etc.)

Planned Features:
- TCP/IP stack
- Finish Ext2 implementation
- a GUI
- toy compiler/interpreter for custom shell scripting language

At some point I want to do a rewrite in C++
